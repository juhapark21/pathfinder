# Memory Game 
My submission for pathfinder is a board with 4 keys and 4 LEDs. You can play a memory game by watching a sequence of lights then pressing the corresponding keys in the same order. Press a specific key combination before starting the game to turn on hard mode, where the lights will flash 10x faster.
